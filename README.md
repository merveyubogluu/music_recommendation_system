# Music Recommendation System with Python

This project uses the  https://www.kaggle.com/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db/code dataset, you can find it on the link. In the project, i created some functions to build the project. Main purpose of the project is developing a music recommender with python. It has 2 options. In the first option you can search the database and see some songs you search. In the second option you write a song name and an artist name of the song, the model will search the database and find the closest song in the dataset. Acording to that song it will measure the cosine distance with every other song in the dataset. It'll want you to enter some number of recommendations, and it will give you those recommendations.

## Functions

### find_song

This function is for finding songs in the dataset. As i told before, it searchs the dataset.

### similar tracks

This function is the second option. You may skip entering the name of a track and find closest songs to the artist of you want to see.

## Final Comments

I developed this programme in a really short time, so there might be some errors. If there is any errors, i will be glad if you tell me those things. So i hope you enjoy it.
